# Corral

Corral is a list of repositories of open education materials for teaching open-source development. The materials are developed and maintained by a community of educators. Corral is part of the foss2serve.org project.

## Find Materials

The list of repositories is in repositories.md.

## Share Your Materials

Assuming you have a repository that meets the guidelines below, add your repositories to repositories.md as follows:

1. Fork this project
2. Add to repositories.md a URL to your repository. The URL should start with `http:` or `https:` and end in `.git`.
3. Issue a pull request back to this project

## Repository Guidelines

The following guidelines will help make your work accessible and reusable for others.
Each repository must...

- Store exactly one 30-80 minute activity/lesson/etc.
- Be publicly accessible (e.g., public on GitLab).
- Contain a README.md in the root that follows the structure demonstrated in template-README.md.
- Tag its releases using [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) (e.g., 0.1.0, 1.0.2)

[What about organizing repositories that organize lessons/activities/etc. into a lesson plan? And even "bigger" ones that organize these lesson plans in to a unit, and even "bigger" organizing units into courses? I'm imagining a tool that takes a list of modules/lessons/activities with their version numbers, and pulls them down into a single directory ready for use. Baby steps. Baby steps.]
